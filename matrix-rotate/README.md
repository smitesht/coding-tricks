# Rotate by 90 degree

Given a square matrix of size N x N. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 3
matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
              {4, 5, 6}
              {7, 8, 9}}
Output:
Rotated Matrix:
3 6 9
2 5 8
1 4 7

```

Example 2:

```
Input:
N = 2
matrix[][] = {{1, 2},
              {3, 4}}
Output:
Rotated Matrix:
2 4
1 3

```
